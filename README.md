# Eldritch Horror Field RNG üêô
This is a small tool to determine a random field in the board game Eldritch Horror. While playing this game it may occur that a random field must be chosen, which can get complicated since some are named instead of numerated. This tool does provide a simple and neat solution to this matter.
